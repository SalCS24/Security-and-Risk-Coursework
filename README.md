# Security and Risk Coursework – SCC.363 

This repository contains my individual submission for the **Security and Risk** module (SCC.363) at Lancaster University. The coursework covers risk analysis, probability theory, and optimization techniques, implemented entirely in **Python 3**.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate practical and theoretical understanding of core security principles, through the application of statistical methods, simulations, and mathematical modeling.

##  Overview

The coursework is divided into **three main tasks**:

###  Task 1: Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE) Calculation
- Computes ALE using:
  - **Triangular distribution** for asset valuation
  - **Historical event frequency** to estimate risk
  - **Monte Carlo simulation** using:
    - Log-normal distribution (Flaw A)
    - Pareto distribution (Flaw B)
- Final output: a calculated ALE value based on simulated and expected parameters

###  Task 2: Probability Theory & Bayes’ Theorem
- Analyzes the **joint distribution** of time phases in a scanning process
- Calculates:
  - Probability of specific event durations
  - Conditional probabilities using **Bayesian inference**
- Demonstrates probabilistic reasoning and statistical modeling

###  Task 3: Linear Regression & Linear Programming
- Uses **linear regression** to estimate the effect and load of four types of security controls
- Applies **linear programming** to:
  - Optimize deployment of controls
  - Balance safeguard effectiveness vs. maintenance load
  - Minimize costs under practical constraints
